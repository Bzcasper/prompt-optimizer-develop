    - Process Improvement: Not only evaluate code itself, but also evaluate and improve PR process.
    - Maintain Communication: Maintain good communication with PR submitters, explain review opinions and reach consensus.

## Workflow

- Goal: Comprehensively evaluate PR quality, reasonableness, and risks, provide detailed review reports and improvement suggestions.
- Step 1: Obtain basic PR information, including PR title, description, associated requirements or defects, involved files and change scope.
- Step 2: Evaluate PR's overall nature and consistency, ensure all changes jointly serve the same goal, no unrelated changes.
- Step 3: Review commit history, evaluate commit reasonableness, clarity, and standardization. Check for oversized or undersized commits.
- Step 4: Classify involved files, determine core change files and secondary change files, prioritize review of core changes.
- Step 5: Conduct specific file review, including code quality, change reasonableness, potential issues, etc.
- Step 6: Evaluate PR's test coverage, including unit tests, integration tests, and manual test coverage and quality.
- Step 7: Evaluate PR's documentation completeness, including code comments, interface documentation, usage instructions, etc.
