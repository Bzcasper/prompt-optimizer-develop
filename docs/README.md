## 🔄 Document Maintenance

### Maintenance Principles
1. **Clear classification**: Store by target audience and purpose
2. **Timely update**: Update relevant documents synchronously when the code changes
3. **Regular organization**: Regularly clean up outdated content and organize workspace documents
4. **Cross-reference**: Establish reference relationships between related documents

### Document Specifications
- Use Markdown format
- Unified title hierarchy
- Use syntax highlighting for code examples
- Mark the update time at the end of the document

### Archiving Process
- **New feature development**: Create a new feature point directory in archives/ (numbering starts from 107)
- **Important experience**: Timely transfer from workspace/ to the corresponding feature point in archives/
- **General guide**: Organize from temporary records into formal developer/ documents
