## Related Code Changes
- Affected Packages: @prompt-optimizer/core, @prompt-optimizer/ui, @prompt-optimizer/web, @prompt-optimizer/extension
- Major Changes:
  - Implementation of Template Management Functionality
  - Optimization of Asynchronous Operations
  - Improvement of Error Handling
  - **Event Propagation Mechanism Enhancement**: Fix the issue of the iteration page not updating after switching the built-in template language

## Known Issues and Solutions
- Template Deletion Error "Template not found": Missing await keyword in asynchronous method calls
- Modal Rendering Issue: Missing v-if directive to control display
- Template Manager Call Logic: Optimize the association between mode selection and template management
- **Iteration page not updating after switching built-in template language**: Missing event propagation mechanism, a complete event propagation chain needs to be established

## Subsequent Impact
- Enhance user experience in template management
- Reduce errors related to template operations
- Lay the foundation for advanced template functionalities

## Related Functionality Points
- Pre-requisite Dependency: 105-output-display-v2
- Subsequent Features: To be planned
