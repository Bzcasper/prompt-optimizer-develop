# Context Editor Refactor - Technical Implementation

## Implementation Steps Record

### Phase 1: Identification and Removal of Deprecated Components

#### 1.1 Component Analysis
Through the spec workflow system analysis, the following deprecated components were identified:
- `ConversationMessageEditor.vue` - Functionality has been inlined into ConversationManager
- `ConversationSection.vue` - Replaced by ConversationManager

#### 1.2 File System Cleanup
```bash
# Removed files
rm packages/ui/src/components/ConversationMessageEditor.vue
rm packages/ui/src/components/ConversationSection.vue
```

#### 1.3 Export Declaration Cleanup
Removed from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Removed exports
export { default as ConversationMessageEditor } from './components/ConversationMessageEditor.vue'
export { default as ConversationSection } from './components/ConversationSection.vue'
```

#### 1.4 Type Definition Cleanup
Removed from `packages/ui/src/types/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Removed type exports
ConversationSectionProps,
ConversationSectionEmits,
```

### Phase 2: Test Code Cleanup

#### 2.1 Test File Updates
Updated the following test files to remove references to deprecated components:
- `tests/unit/components/TestAreaPanel.spec.ts`
- `tests/unit/components/test-area-e2e.spec.ts`
- `tests/unit/components/test-area-integration.spec.ts`

#### 2.2 Mock Cleanup
Removed mock code related to ConversationSection:
```javascript
// Removed mock
vi.mock('../../../src/components/ConversationSection.vue', () => ({
  // mock content
}))
```

### Phase 3: API Optimization

#### 3.1 ConversationManager Props Analysis
Through code analysis, the following unused props were found:
- `:is-predefined-variable` - Defined only in default value, not actually used
- `:replace-variables` - Defined only in default value, not actually used

#### 3.2 ContextEditor Props Analysis
Identified and removed:
- `:is-predefined-variable` - Not used in ContextEditor

#### 3.3 App.vue Optimization
Removed unused prop passing in `packages/web/src/App.vue`:

**ConversationManager (lines 155-165):**
```vue
<!-- Before removal -->
<ConversationManager
  :is-predefined-variable="(name) => variableManager?.variableManager.value?.isPredefinedVariable(name) || false"
  :replace-variables="(content, vars) => variableManager?.variableManager.value?.replaceVariables(content, vars) || content"
  <!-- Other props -->
/>

<!-- After removal -->
<ConversationManager
  <!-- Only keep actually used props -->
/>
```

**ContextEditor (lines 296-308):**
```vue
<!-- Before removal -->
<ContextEditor
  :is-predefined-variable="(name) => variableManager?.variableManager.value?.isPredefinedVariable(name) || false"
  <!-- Other props -->
/>

<!-- After removal -->
<ContextEditor
  <!-- Keep scan-variables and replace-variables, as these are actually used in ContextEditor -->
/>
```

## Technical Discoveries

### Vue Props Naming Mechanism
Discovered the automatic naming conversion mechanism in Vue 3:
- `:available-variables` automatically maps to `availableVariables`
- `@open-variable-manager` automatically maps to `openVariableManager`
- This mechanism ensures backward compatibility, allowing previously "incorrect" usages to work properly

### Component Usage Analysis Method
Used the following methods to analyze actual prop usage:
```bash
# Find prop usage
grep -n "props\." ComponentName.vue

# Find emit calls
grep -n "emit(" ComponentName.vue
```

### Build Verification Strategy
Adopted the following verification strategies:
1. TypeScript compilation checks
2. Development server startup verification
3. Browser automation functional testing

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impact
- **Reduced Prop Passing**: Removing unused props decreased unnecessary data passing
- **Reduced Component Count**: Removing deprecated components reduced package size
- **Simplified Dependencies**: The cleaned-up dependencies are clearer

### Performance Test Results
```
- Build Time: No significant change
- Package Size: UI package size slightly reduced
- Runtime Performance: No significant difference
- Memory Usage: Reduced component count, theoretically optimizing memory usage slightly
```

## Rollback Strategy

If a rollback is needed, follow these steps:
1. Restore the deleted component files
2. Restore export declarations and type definitions
3. Restore relevant code in test files
4. Restore prop passing in App.vue

Note: Since all removals were of deprecated functionality, a rollback is generally not necessary.

## Code Quality Metrics

### Before Refactoring
- Component File Count: 70+
- Unused Exports: 2
- Redundant Prop Passing: 4
- Expired Test Code: Multiple instances

### After Refactoring
- Component File Count: 68
- Unused Exports: 0
- Redundant Prop Passing: 0
- Expired Test Code: Cleared
