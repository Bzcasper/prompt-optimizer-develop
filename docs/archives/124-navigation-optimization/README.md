## 🎉 Major Achievements

### Architectural Improvements
- **🏗️ Unified Component Architecture**: Extension directly uses Web's App.vue, achieving "one codebase for multiple platforms."
- **🔧 Layout Anchor Point Strategy**: An innovative cross-mode stable layout solution, becoming a reusable design pattern.
- **📦 Component Cleanup**: Removed 2 deprecated components, simplifying project architecture.

### Stability Enhancements
- **🎯 Zero Displacement Layout**: 100% resolved button jumping issues during mode switching.
- **📱 Responsive Enhancement**: Perfect adaptation across 3 device sizes (Mobile/Tablet/Desktop).
- **🎨 Theme Compatibility**: Full compatibility with 5 themes (light/dark/blue/green/purple).

### Development Experience Optimization
- **📚 Improved Documentation**: Component usage guide, best practices, multilingual extension guidance.
- **🚀 Extensibility**: LanguageSwitchDropdown lays the foundation for future multilingual support.
- **🔄 Maintainability**: Code cleanup and architecture unification reduce long-term maintenance costs.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Identified To-Dos
- **Unit Test Reinforcement**: LanguageSwitchDropdown component test coverage (Priority: Low).
- **Animation Effect Optimization**: Smooth transition animations for mode switching (Priority: Low).
- **Accessibility Feature Enhancement**: More ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support (Priority: Medium).

### Suggested Improvement Directions
- **Multilingual Expansion**: Add more language options based on the existing dropdown component.
- **Navigation Bar Personalization**: Allow users to customize button order and display.
- **Theme Customization Expansion**: Deep customization of navigation bar colors and styles.
