## Task: Core Service Interface Isolation Refactoring - 2025-07-03

### Goal
Check each reference of the `ui` module to the `core` module to ensure all calls are made through interfaces (such as `IModelManager`) rather than concrete implementation classes (such as `ModelManager`). Standardize the calling conventions for both Web and Desktop versions, and fix the IPC communication link issues that arise from this.

### Planned Steps
*See `todo.md`*

### Progress Record
- **2025-07-03**: **Milestone Achieved: Core Manager Refactoring**
  - **Outcome**: Successfully refactored `ModelManager` and `HistoryManager`. An adapter was created in `useAppInitializer.ts` to enforce that the UI layer only calls through interfaces.
  - **Discovery**: The "shortcut" that allows the Web application to work (directly calling instances) is the root cause of the failure in the Desktop version (multi-process IPC). Architecturally, implementation details must be masked at the source of initialization.
  - **Status**: Updates to `IModelManager`, `IHistoryManager`, and their corresponding implementations, proxies, and IPC links have been completed.

### Issue Record
