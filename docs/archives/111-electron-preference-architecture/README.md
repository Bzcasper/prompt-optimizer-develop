# Electron PreferenceService Architecture Refactoring and Race Condition Fix

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**Project ID**: 111  
**Project Name**: Electron PreferenceService Architecture Refactoring and Race Condition Fix  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-01  
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-01  
**Status**: âœ… Completed

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

### Main Goals
1. **Resolve the issue of UI state not being persistent in the Electron environment** - By refactoring the PreferenceService architecture
2. **Fix race condition errors** - Address the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'preference')" error
3. **Unify API access paths** - Standardize the API calling method in the Electron environment

### Technical Goals
- Replace the UI layer's direct dependency on `useStorage` with `PreferenceService`
- Implement IPC communication mechanism in the Electron environment
- Establish API availability checks and lazy initialization mechanisms

## âœ… Completion Status

### Core Features (100% Complete)
- âœ… Created the `IPreferenceService` interface and implementation
- âœ… Implemented the `ElectronPreferenceServiceProxy` proxy service
- âœ… Established a complete IPC communication mechanism
- âœ… Resolved API initialization timing issues
- âœ… Fixed API path mismatch issues

### Technical Implementation (100% Complete)
- âœ… Enhanced environment detection: `isElectronApiReady()` and `waitForElectronApi()`
- âœ… Proxy service protection: `ensureApiAvailable()` method
- âœ… Optimized initialization timing: Asynchronously wait for API readiness
- âœ… API path standardization: Unified use of `window.electronAPI.preference`

### Testing Validation (100% Complete)
- âœ… 252/262 test cases passed
- âœ… Electron application successfully started
- âœ… Basic functionality operating normally
- âœ… Race condition issue completely resolved

## ðŸŽ‰ Major Achievements

### 1. Architecture Improvements
- **Service Layer Decoupling**: The UI layer no longer directly depends on `useStorage`
- **Environment Adaptation**: Web and Electron environments use a unified interface
- **Proxy Pattern**: IPC communication in the Electron environment is achieved through a proxy service

### 2. Stability Enhancement
- **Race Condition Fix**: Thoroughly resolved initialization timing issues
- **Error Handling Enhancement**: Added API availability checks
- **Timeout Protection**: 5-second timeout mechanism to prevent infinite waiting

### 3. Development Experience Optimization
- **Unified API**: All environments use the same PreferenceService interface
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive debugging information and error prompts
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript type definitions
