# Vue Composable Architecture Refactoring Implementation Record

## üìã Task Overview

Address the error caused by calling Vue Composable functions in asynchronous callbacks: `Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Must be called at the top of a 'setup' function`. Refactor all Composable files to implement the design pattern of "top-level declaration, reactive connection, internal autonomy".

## üéØ Goals

- Resolve the timing issue of Vue Composable calls
- Establish a unified service interface definition
- Implement reactive service dependency injection
- Improve code consistency and maintainability

## üìÖ Execution Record

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps

#### 1. Create a Unified Service Interface Definition
- **Completion Date**: July 5, 2025, Morning
- **Actual Result**: Successfully created the `packages/ui/src/types/services.ts` file, defining the `AppServices` interface
- **Experience Summary**: Centralizing type definitions improved code consistency and maintainability

#### 2. Refactor Core Composable Files
- **Completion Date**: July 5, 2025, Afternoon
- **Actual Result**: Successfully refactored 8 major Composable files to accept the `services: Ref<AppServices | null>` parameter
- **Experience Summary**: A unified parameter pattern made the code more consistent and easier to understand

#### 3. Update useAppInitializer
- **Completion Date**: July 5, 2025, Evening
- **Actual Result**: Enhanced error handling and logging, added an `error` state
- **Experience Summary**: Good error handling is crucial for debugging

#### 4. Update useModals
- **Completion Date**: July 5, 2025, Evening
- **Actual Result**: Incorporated useModals into the new architecture, accepting the services parameter
- **Experience Summary**: Maintaining architectural consistency is very important for long-term maintenance

#### 5. Update Documentation
- **Completion Date**: July 5, 2025, Evening
- **Actual Result**: Updated architectural documentation and experience records
- **Experience Summary**: Timely documentation of architectural decisions and experiences is important for team knowledge transfer

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Resolve

#### 6. Update App.vue
- **In Progress**: July 6, 2025
- **Current Status**: Encountered type errors that need further resolution
- **Issue Record**:
  - The `services` object does not match the `AppServices` interface, especially the `dataManager` property
  - Attempted to use type assertion `as any` as a temporary solution, but type errors still persist
  - Further research is needed on the `DataManager` type definition and implementation

## üîß Core Solutions

### Architectural Pattern
```typescript
// ‚ùå Error: Calling Composable in an asynchronous callback
onMounted(async () => {
  const services = await initServices();
  const modelManager = useModelManager(); // Error: Not called at the top level of setup
});

// ‚úÖ Correct: Top-level declaration, reactive connection
const { services } = useAppInitializer(); // Called at the top level
const modelManager = useModelManager(services); // Called at the top level, passing in services reference

// Internal implementation: Reactive connection
export function useModelManager(services: Ref<AppServices | null>) {
  // State definitions...
  
  // Reactive connection: Listen for service readiness
  watch(services, (newServices) => {
    if (!newServices) return;
    // Use the ready services...
  }, { immediate: true });
  
  return { /* Return state and methods */ };
}
```

### Service Interface Definition
```typescript
// packages/ui/src/types/services.ts
export interface AppServices {
  storageProvider: IStorageProvider;
  modelManager: IModelManager;
  templateManager: ITemplateManager;
  historyManager: IHistoryManager;
  dataManager: DataManager;
  llmService: ILLMService;
  promptService: IPromptService;
}
```

## üìä Progress Status

**Core Goals 80% Achieved**:
- ‚úÖ Resolved the `Must be called at the top of a 'setup' function` error
- ‚úÖ Implemented a unified, predictable Composable design pattern
- ‚úÖ Improved code maintainability and robustness
- ‚úÖ Completed comprehensive documentation updates
- ‚ùå Type errors in App.vue still need to be resolved

**Technical Implementation**:
- Created a centralized `AppServices` interface
- Refactored 9 Composable files using a unified parameter pattern
- Enhanced error handling and logging in `useAppInitializer`
- Adopted a "fail fast" approach to expose potential issues early

**Architectural Features**:
- All Composables are called at the top level in `<script setup>`
- Composables accept `services: Ref<Services | null>` parameters
- Internally responds to service readiness via `watch(services, ...)`
- Clear unidirectional dependencies

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Resolve Type Errors in App.vue**:
   - Deep dive into the `DataManager` type definition and implementation
   - Check the structure of the object returned by `useAppInitializer`
   - May need to adjust the `AppServices` interface or service implementation

2. **Add Error Handling UI**:
   - Utilize the `error` state returned by `useAppInitializer`
   - Add a user-friendly error prompt interface

3. **Write Architectural Guidelines**:
   - Create detailed architectural guidelines for new developers
   - Explain the correct usage of Composables

## üí° Core Experience Summary

1. **Vue Reactive Context**: Vue Composables must be synchronously called at the top level of `<script setup>`
2. **Reactive Connection Pattern**: Use `watch(services, ...)` pattern to handle asynchronous service initialization
3. **Fail Fast Principle**: In development environments, exposing issues quickly is more valuable than hiding them
4. **Unified Architecture**: Maintain a consistent architectural pattern across all Composables
5. **Type System Challenges**: Complex type systems can lead to interface mismatch issues
