# Core Experience of Layout System

## 📋 Overview

A summary of core experiences in the dynamic Flex layout system of the project, including layout principles, common problem solutions, debugging methods, and best practices.

## 🎯 Core Layout Experience: Dynamic Flex Layout

**This is the most important experience of this project.** Abandon fixed sizes and fully utilize Flexbox for dynamic space allocation.

### Core Principles
- **Highest Guiding Principle**: For an element to act as a Flex item (`flex-1`) and be flexible, its direct parent must be a Flex container (`display: flex`).
- **Constraint Chain Integrity**: All relevant parent-child elements from top to bottom must adhere to Flex rules.
- **Golden Combination**: `flex: 1` + `min-h-0` (or `min-w-0`).

### Implementation Key Points
```css
/* Parent Container */
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100vh; /* or other explicit height */
}

/* Dynamic Child Item */
.child {
  flex: 1;
  min-height: 0; /* Key: allows shrinking */
}

/* Scrollable Container */
.scrollable {
  flex: 1;
  min-height: 0;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

### Debugging Method
When the Flex layout fails, start from the problematic element and check each parent layer to see if it is `display: flex`.

## 🔧 Key Bug Fix Cases

### 1. Fixing Broken Flex Constraint Chain
**Typical Error**:
```html
<!-- ❌ Parent container is not flex, child element flex-1 fails -->
<div class="h-full relative">
  <TextDiff class="flex-1 min-h-0" />
</div>

<!-- ✅ Correct: Parent container must be flex -->
<div class="h-full flex flex-col">
  <TextDiff class="flex-1 min-h-0" />
</div>
```

### 2. Fixing Complex Responsive Layout in TestPanel (2024-12-21)

#### Problem Phenomenon
There is a flex layout issue in the test result area of TestPanel.vue, where content is pushed upwards instead of correctly occupying available space, especially when using vertical stacking layout in small screen mode.

#### Root Cause
1. **Incomplete Height Constraint Propagation**: The flex container lacks the `min-h-0` constraint, causing child items to not shrink correctly.
2. **Improper Handling of Mixed Layout Modes**: Absolute positioning is used on large screens, while flex layout is used on small screens, leading to inconsistent height constraint rules between the two modes.
3. **Title Element Participating in Space Allocation**: The h3 title is not marked as `flex-none`, incorrectly participating in flex space allocation.

#### Fix Proposal
```html
<!-- Before Fix: Missing critical min-h-0 constraint -->
<div class="flex flex-col transition-all duration-300 min-h-[80px]">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold theme-text truncate mb-3">Title</h3>
  <OutputDisplay class="flex-1" />
</div>

<!-- After Fix: Complete flex constraint chain -->
<div class="flex flex-col min-h-0 transition-all duration-300 min-h-[80px]">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold theme-text truncate mb-3 flex-none">Title</h3>
  <OutputDisplay class="flex-1 min-h-0" />
</div>
```

#### Key Fix Points
- Add `min-h-0` constraint to each result container.
- Mark the title as `flex-none` to prevent it from participating in space allocation.  
- Add `min-h-0` to the OutputDisplay component to ensure height constraints are correctly propagated to the component.

#### Experience Summary
- In complex responsive layouts, each layout mode (flex vs absolute) needs to independently verify height constraints.
- Components in mixed layout modes are particularly prone to constraint propagation breaks and need to be checked layer by layer.
- Fixed-height elements like titles must be explicitly marked as `flex-none`.

## 🎯 Best Practices for UI State Synchronization and Responsive Data Flow (2024-12-21)

### Typical Problem
In complex Vue component interactions, changes in the internal state of child components do not correctly reflect in other sibling components, leading to inconsistencies between UI display and underlying data. For example, after a user edits content in component A, component B (like the test panel) still receives data from before the edit.

### Root Cause Analysis
The core of this problem lies in the synchronization gap between **unidirectional data flow** and **component local state**. When an internal state of a child component (like `OutputDisplay`) changes (`editingContent`), it notifies the parent component to update the top-level state via `emit` events. However, other sibling components (like `TestPanel`) that depend on the same top-level state receive static `props` that do not automatically respond to indirectly triggered state changes from `emit`, resulting in data desynchronization.

### Solution: Build a Reliable Responsive Data Flow Architecture

**Core Objective**: Ensure that any state change resulting from user interaction is **immediately, unidirectionally** synchronized back to a single data source (Single Source of Truth), allowing all components dependent on that data source to automatically respond to updates.

#### Implementation Patterns

1. **Pattern One: Real-time State Hoisting**

   Child components should not hold temporary, unsynchronized "draft" states. Any editable state should be synchronized upwards through `emit` events at the moment of change, rather than waiting for a specific action (like "save" or "blur") to trigger.

   ```typescript
   // Child Component: OutputDisplayCore.vue
   // Synchronize internal editing content to parent in real-time through watch
   watch(editingContent, (newContent) => {
     if (isEditing.value) {
       emit('update:content', newContent);
     }
   }, { immediate: false });
   ```

2. **Pattern Two: Timing and Race Condition Control**

   For asynchronous operations that require clearing or resetting state (like starting a streaming load), it is crucial to ensure that state change operations (like exiting editing or clearing content) are completed before the asynchronous task begins. `nextTick` is key to resolving such DOM update and state change race conditions.

   ```typescript
   // State Management: usePromptOptimizer.ts
   async function handleOptimize() {
       isOptimizing.value = true;
       optimizedPrompt.value = ''; // 1. Synchronize clearing state
       await nextTick();          // 2. Wait for DOM and state updates to complete
       
       // 3. Start asynchronous service
       await promptService.value.optimizePromptStream(...);
   }
   ```

3. **Pattern Three: External Event-Driven State Reset**

   When an action (like optimization) needs to affect the state of sibling components (like forcing exit from editing), it should be implemented through top-level component listening and method calls (`ref.method()`), rather than direct communication between components.

   ```typescript
   // Parent Component: PromptPanel.vue
   // Listen for top-level state changes and call child component methods
   watch(() => props.isOptimizing, (newVal) => {
     if (newVal) {
       outputDisplayRef.value?.forceExitEditing();
     }
   });
   ```

### Core Design Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: Any shared state must be owned by a unique, higher-level component or state manager. Child components can only receive state through `props` and request changes through `emit`.
- **Responsive Data Flow Loop**: Ensure that the data flow of "user input -> `emit` -> update top-level state -> `props` -> update all related child components" is complete and automatically responsive.
- **Systematic Debugging Strategy**: When encountering state desynchronization issues, adding temporary logs from the data source (top-level state) to the consumer (child component Props) layer by layer is the most effective way to quickly locate data flow "breakpoints."

## ⚡ Quick Problem Diagnosis

### Layout Issues
1. Check if the Flex constraint chain is complete.
2. Confirm if `min-h-0` is added.
3. Verify if the parent container is `display: flex`.

### Scrolling Issues
1. Check for incorrect `overflow` properties in intermediate layers.
2. Confirm if height constraints are correctly propagated from the top level.
3. Verify if the scrollable container has the correct `overflow-y: auto`.

### State Synchronization Issues
1. Check if the data flow forms a closed loop.
2. Confirm if there are temporary states that are not synchronized.
3. Verify the dependency relationships between components.

## 💡 Core Experience Summary

1. **Flex Constraint Chain**: The Flex constraint chain must remain complete from top to bottom.
2. **Minimum Height Constraint**: `min-h-0` is key to dynamic layouts, allowing elements to shrink correctly.
3. **Mixed Layout Verification**: Different layout modes need independent verification of constraint propagation.
4. **State Synchronization**: Establish a complete responsive data flow to avoid inconsistencies in component states.
5. **Systematic Debugging**: Layer-by-layer checks of constraint chains and data flows to quickly locate the root of issues.
