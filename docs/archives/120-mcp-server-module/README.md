# MCP Server Module Development

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
- **Project ID**: 120
- **Project Name**: MCP Server Module Development
- **Time**: 2025-07-18 ~ 2025-07-26
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Add MCP (Model Context Protocol) server module to the prompt-optimizer project
- Focus on providing a prompt optimization tool that can be directly used by LLM applications and clients that support MCP
- Achieve a zero-intrusion design, without modifying the Core module code

## âœ… Completion Status
- Core functionality completion status: âœ… Completed
  - Design and implementation of MCP Server infrastructure
  - Implementation of 3 core tools (optimize-user-prompt, optimize-system-prompt, iterate-prompt)
  - Support for dual transmission methods (stdio and HTTP)
- Technical implementation completion status: âœ… Completed
  - Core service adaptation layer
  - Parameter conversion adapter
  - Error handling adapter
  - Environment variable configuration management

## ðŸŽ‰ Major Achievements
- **Architecture Improvement**: Implemented a zero-intrusive MCP Server module that fully reuses Core module functionality
  - Adopted a layered architecture design with clear responsibilities
  - Used the adapter pattern to achieve protocol conversion
  - Maintained complete decoupling from the Core module
- **Stability Enhancement**: Resolved key issues such as environment variable loading timing and background processes during build
  - Environment variable preloading mechanism
  - Control of side effects during build
  - Windows compatibility optimization
- **Development Experience Optimization**: Provided comprehensive documentation and examples for easier use and integration by other developers
  - Detailed technical implementation documentation
  - Rich development experience summaries
  - Complete pitfalls avoidance guide

## ðŸš€ Follow-up Work
- Identified to-do items:
  - Testing integration with Claude Desktop
  - Improving error handling and logging system
  - Writing usage documentation and deployment guide
  - Performance optimization and stability testing
