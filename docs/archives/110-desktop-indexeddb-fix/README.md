# Desktop IndexedDB Issue Fix Task Summary

## üìã Task Overview
- **Task Type**: Bug Fix + Architectural Improvement
- **Start Date**: 2025-01-01
- **Completion Date**: 2025-01-01
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Priority**: High (Affects normal use of Desktop application)

## üéØ Issue Description
Users found that in the Desktop application, even in the Electron environment, the IndexedDB database can still be seen in the developer tools, which violates the architectural design of the Desktop application (it should only use memory storage in the main process).

## üîç Issue Analysis

### Root Cause
1. **Module-level Storage Creation**: There is a module-level `StorageFactory.createDefault()` call in `packages/core/src/services/prompt/factory.ts`.
2. **TemplateLanguageService Constructor**: Calls `createDefault()` with default parameters.
3. **Legacy Data**: Previously created IndexedDB data is persistently stored in the browser.

### Architectural Issues
- **Design Violation**: The Electron rendering process should not have any local storage instances.
- **Data Inconsistency**: The rendering process and the main process may have different data states.
- **Accidental Creation**: The `createDefault()` method creates IndexedDB in any environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

### Core Fixes
1. **Completely Remove `StorageFactory.createDefault()` Method**
2. **Fix `TemplateLanguageService` Constructor**: Change to require a storage parameter.
3. **Refactor `prompt/factory.ts`**: Remove module-level storage creation and switch to dependency injection.
4. **Fix API Call Error**: `getModels()` ‚Üí `getAllModels()`

### Architectural Improvements
- **Enforce Explicitness**: All storage creation must explicitly specify the type.
- **Prevent Accidental Creation**: Prevent automatic creation of IndexedDB in inappropriate environments.
- **Proxy Architecture Enhancement**: The Electron rendering process fully uses proxy services.

## üìÅ Modified Files

### Core Package Modifications
- `packages/core/src/services/storage/factory.ts` - Removed createDefault() and getCurrentDefault().
- `packages/core/src/services/template/languageService.ts` - Constructor changed to require storage.
- `packages/core/src/services/prompt/factory.ts` - Refactored to use dependency injection.
- `packages/core/src/services/prompt/service.ts` - Removed duplicate function definitions.
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` - Fixed export paths.
- `packages/core/tests/integration/storage-implementations.test.ts` - Updated tests.

### Desktop Package Modifications
- `packages/desktop/package.json` - Added missing dependencies.
- `packages/desktop/main.js` - Fixed API call errors.
- `packages/desktop/build.js` - Created cross-platform build script.

### UI Package Modifications
- `packages/ui/src/composables/useAppInitializer.ts` - Fixed Electron storage proxy.

### Cleaned Up Over-Fixes
- Removed Electron environment warnings in DexieStorageProvider.
- Simplified detailed debug information in useAppInitializer.
- Deleted unnecessary listTemplatesByTypeAsync method.

## üß™ Testing Verification

### Test Results
- ‚úÖ Desktop application successfully launched.
- ‚úÖ Main process correctly uses memory storage.
- ‚úÖ Rendering process uses proxy services.
- ‚úÖ Templates loaded normally (7 templates).
- ‚úÖ Web development server runs normally.
- ‚úÖ No automatic creation of IndexedDB.

### User Verification
- ‚úÖ After manually deleting IndexedDB, restarting the application no longer creates IndexedDB.
- ‚úÖ Application functions normally, interface loads correctly.

## üí° Key Takeaways

### Architectural Principles
1. **Enforcing Explicitness is More Important than Convenience**: Removing `createDefault()` forces developers to explicitly specify storage types.
2. **Avoid Module-Level Side Effects**: Module imports should not produce side effects like storage creation.
3. **Dependency Injection is Better than Default Values**: Explicit dependency passing is safer than implicit default values.

### Debugging Experience
1. **Impact of Legacy Data**: Historical data must be cleaned up even after code fixes.
2. **Timing of Environment Detection**: Electron environment detection needs to consider the timing of preload script execution.
3. **Identification of Over-Fixes**: Avoid unnecessary complexity during the fixing process.

### Code Quality
1. **Timely Cleanup of Useless Code**: Such as invalid methods like `getCurrentDefault()`.
2. **Avoid Over-Defense**: Such as environment warnings in DexieStorageProvider.
3. **Maintain Interface Consistency**: Web and Electron versions should use the same interfaces as much as possible.
