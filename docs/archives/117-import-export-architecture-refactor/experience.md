# Development Experience Summary

## üéØ Core Experience

### Systematic Approach to Large-Scale Architecture Refactoring

#### 1. Deep Root Cause Analysis for Problem Identification
**Experience**: Surface issues often point to deeper architectural problems.
- **Phenomenon**: Data export has only 4 settings instead of 8.
- **Surface Cause**: PreferenceService returns incomplete data.
- **Root Cause**: Unclear design of dual-purpose storage keys.
- **Architectural Issue**: Centralized DataManager takes on too many responsibilities.

**Best Practices**: 
- Do not rush to fix surface issues.
- Conduct a thorough analysis of the systemic causes of problems.
- Consider whether architectural improvements are needed.

#### 2. Interface-First Design Principle
**Experience**: Design interfaces first, then implement specific functionalities.
```typescript
// Define clear interfaces first
export interface IImportExportable {
  exportData(): Promise<any>;
  importData(data: any): Promise<void>;
  getDataType(): Promise<string>;
  validateData(data: any): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Forces consideration of responsibility boundaries.
- Facilitates parallel development.
- Improves code testability.
- Supports dependency injection.

#### 3. Incremental Refactoring Strategy
**Experience**: Large-scale refactoring should be done in phases to maintain functional continuity.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Interface Definition** - Create new interfaces to avoid circular dependencies.
2. **Service Transformation** - Implement new interfaces one service at a time.
3. **Coordination Layer Refactoring** - Modify DataManager last.
4. **Testing Validation** - Ensure each phase has test coverage.

**Key Principles**:
- Keep existing API interfaces unchanged.
- Allow old and new systems to coexist for a period.
- Remove old code only after thorough testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Experience

### Storage Key Architecture Design

#### Clear Separation of Dual Purposes
**Problem**: Storage keys are used for both physical storage and JSON export, leading to confusion.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Physical storage key (with prefix)
'pref:app:settings:ui:theme-id'

// Logical JSON key (without prefix)  
'app:settings:ui:theme-id'
```

**Design Principles**:
- Handle prefix conversion internally within the service.
- Expose a unified logical key name externally.
- Document the mapping relationship of the two purposes.

#### Unified Storage Key Management
**Experience**: Eliminate duplicate definitions and establish a single data source.
- Move storage-keys.ts from the UI package to the Core package.
- All modules reference the same definition file.
- Avoid magic strings scattered throughout the code.

### Electron IPC Architecture

#### Serialization Issue Handling
**Problem**: Vue reactive objects cannot be transmitted via IPC.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Perform deep serialization at the proxy layer
async exportData(): Promise<any> {
  const result = await window.electronAPI.service.exportData();
  return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(result));
}
```

**Best Practices**:
- Serialize data at the IPC boundary.
- Use TypeScript types to ensure correct data structure.
- Consider performance impacts with large data volumes.

#### Proxy Layer Design Pattern
**Experience**: Proxy classes should only handle IPC communication, not implement business logic.
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Only responsible for forwarding
async getDataType(): Promise<string> {
  return await window.electronAPI.service.getDataType();
}

// ‚ùå Incorrect: Implementing logic in the proxy layer
async getDataType(): Promise<string> {
  return 'hardcoded-value'; // Should call IPC
}
```

### Testing Strategy

- Repeatable test cases.

**Value**:
- Quickly identify regression issues.
- Validate architectural consistency.
- Increase test coverage.

## üö´ Pitfall Guide

### Architectural Design Traps

#### 1. Over-Centralization
**Trap**: Allowing one class to take on too many responsibilities.
**Manifestation**: DataManager both coordinates and implements specific logic.
**Consequence**: Code becomes difficult to maintain and extend.

**Avoidance Methods**:
- Follow the single responsibility principle.
- Use interfaces to separate concerns.
- Regularly refactor overly large classes.

#### 2. Inconsistent Interface Design
**Trap**: Different services use different method signatures.
**Manifestation**: Some return Promises, while others return synchronously.
**Consequence**: Callers need to handle each service specially.

**Avoidance Methods**:
- Standardize interface design.
- Use TypeScript to enforce type checking.
- Focus on interface consistency during code reviews.

#### 3. Storage Abstraction Leakage
**Trap**: Implementation details of the storage layer are exposed to the business layer.
**Manifestation**: Business code needs to know the storage key prefixes.
**Consequence**: Changes in the storage layer affect business logic.

**Avoidance Methods**:
- Encapsulate storage details in the service layer.
- Expose logical key names externally.
- Establish clear abstract boundaries.

### Refactoring Process Traps

#### 1. Destructive Changes
**Trap**: Modifying existing API interfaces.
**Consequence**: Affects existing calling code and introduces regression issues.

**Avoidance Methods**:
- Keep existing interface signatures unchanged.
- Internal refactoring while maintaining external compatibility.
- Conduct thorough regression testing.

#### 2. Insufficient Test Coverage
**Trap**: Lack of adequate test protection during refactoring.
**Consequence**: Introduces hard-to-detect bugs.

**Avoidance Methods**:
- Supplement tests before refactoring.
- Ensure each phase has test validation.
- Use a multi-layered testing strategy.

#### 3. Documentation Lag
**Trap**: Code is refactored but documentation is not updated.
**Consequence**: Inconsistent understanding among team members, making maintenance difficult.

**Avoidance Methods**:
- Update documentation concurrently with refactoring.
- Create Architecture Decision Records (ADR).
- Regularly review the accuracy of documentation.

## üîÑ Architectural Design Experience

### Distributed Service Architecture

#### Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service is responsible only for its own data.
2. **Unified Interfaces**: All services implement the same interface.
3. **Loose Coupling**: Services interact through interfaces without direct dependencies.
4. **Scalability**: New services only need to implement the interface.

#### Implementation Key Points
- Design interfaces first, then implement services.
- Use dependency injection to manage service relationships.
- Establish a unified error handling mechanism.
- Provide complete test coverage.

### Data Consistency Assurance

#### Atomicity of Import and Export
**Challenge**: Data from multiple services needs to remain consistent.
**Solution**: 
- Validate all data formats first.
- Execute the actual import operation afterward.
- Provide a rollback mechanism in case of errors.

#### Version Compatibility
**Design**: Include version information in JSON.
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "exportTime": "2025-01-09T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

**Value**: Supports future data format upgrades.

### Performance Optimization Experience

#### Reduce Unnecessary Data Transfer
- Filter data at the service layer.
- Avoid aggregating large amounts of data at the coordination layer.
- Use streaming processing for large files.

#### Concurrent Processing
- Exports from various services can be executed in parallel.
- Use Promise.all to improve efficiency.
- Be mindful of concurrency limits on IPC calls.
