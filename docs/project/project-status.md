## 13. Chrome Extension Development Experience

### 13.1 Icon Troubleshooting
- The icon settings in manifest.json must strictly follow the Chrome extension specifications
- The icon must be a valid PNG format
- The icon size must strictly match the declaration (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
- If the icon is not displayed, you can try replacing it with other confirmed available PNG images for testing
