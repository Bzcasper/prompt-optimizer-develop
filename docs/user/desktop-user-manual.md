# Prompt Optimizer Desktop User Manual

## 1. Welcome

Welcome to the Prompt Optimizer desktop application! This application is designed to provide a smooth, hassle-free prompt optimization experience, allowing you to focus on creating high-quality prompts without worrying about network configuration issues.

The biggest difference from the web version is that the desktop version can **directly call the APIs of major AI service providers without any proxy or complex settings**.

## 2. Installation and Startup

### System Requirements

-   Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
-   Stable internet connection (for API calls)

### Installation Steps

1.  Download the installation package for your operating system from the specified release page (e.g., Windows users download the `.exe` file).
2.  Double-click the installation package and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.
3.  After installation is complete, find the "Prompt Optimizer" icon on your desktop or in your application list and launch it.

## 3. First-time Configuration: Connecting to Your AI Service

For the application to work, you need to provide an API key for at least one AI service provider.

1.  After launching the application, click the **"Model Management"** icon in the sidebar.
2.  On the model management page, you will see a list of models. Select the service provider you want to use (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.).
3.  **Enter your API Key** in the corresponding input box.
4.  Click the **"Test Connection"** button. If the key is valid and the network is normal, you will see a "Connection successful" message.
5.  Make sure the **"Enable"** switch next to the model you want to use is turned on.

## 4. Basic Usage

1.  **Input Content**: In the "Content to be Optimized" input box on the left, enter the original prompt or text you want to optimize.
2.  **Select Template**: In the "Optimization Template" drop-down menu at the top, select an optimization strategy. For most cases, "General Optimization" is a good start.
3.  **Click Optimize**: Click the **"Optimize"** button in the middle.
4.  **View Results**: The "Optimization Results" area on the right will display the optimized prompt generated by the AI.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Nothing happens or an error is prompted after clicking "Optimize", what should I do?**

**A:** Please troubleshoot according to the following steps:
1.  Make sure your computer is connected to the internet.
2.  Go to the "Model Management" page and click "Test Connection" again to confirm that your API key is still valid.
3.  Confirm that the model corresponding to the optimization template you selected is enabled and configured correctly.

**Q2: The application interface is blank?**

**A:** This may be due to a failure to load application resources. Please try to completely close the application and restart it. If the problem persists, please consider reinstalling the application.

**Q3: Can I use multiple AI service providers at the same time?**

**A:** Yes. You can configure and enable multiple service providers and models in "Model Management". When using, you can select which model to use for optimization in the "Optimization Template" or related settings.

**Q4: Is my API key safe?**

**A:** Yes. In the desktop version, your API key is only stored on your local computer and is only sent directly to the corresponding AI service provider when you initiate an optimization request, without going through any third-party servers.
