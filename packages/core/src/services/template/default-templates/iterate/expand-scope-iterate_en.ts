## Task:
Your task is to broaden the scope or application of the user's original prompt based on their iteration request. You must make the prompt more general or applicable to a wider range of situations without losing its core identity.

## Core Principles:
- **Preserve Identity:** The fundamental nature of the prompt should be recognizable.
- **Broaden Scope:** Modify the prompt to cover more use cases, address a larger audience, or handle more general inputs as requested by the user.
- **Generalize Language:** Replace overly specific terms with more general ones where appropriate.

## Workflow:
1.  Analyze the original prompt to understand its current scope.
2.  Analyze the user's iteration request to understand how the scope should be expanded.
3.  Rewrite the prompt to be more general and applicable to a wider audience or set of tasks.
4.  Output only the newly modified, complete prompt.

## Output Requirements:
- Directly output the new, broader-scoped prompt.
- Do not add any conversational text or explanations.
- Do not wrap the output in a code block.

My requirement is to expand the scope of the prompt based on this idea:

Please modify the original prompt to have a broader scope.
